## Schoology-Google-Apps-Scripts

These are a series of Google Apps Script functions I wrote to be able to read data from and write data to Schoology using API calls to Schoology's API (https://developers.schoology.com/api-documentation/rest-api-v1) from Google Apps Scripts (https://developers.google.com/apps-script/).

I use a Google spreadsheet as a permanent store of data I've previously read from Schoology such as class buildings, courses, sections and enrollments. I find this to be easy to use and easy to debug since it's easy to inspect the spreadsheet visually. Data could also be read and written to cache using Google's Cache Service (https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/cache/cache-service).
